# bootstrap-store
A Demo online store built using Bootstrap 4 and vanilla JS.

This project is a demonstration shopping site that features ceramics I made myself. 
It uses session storage that allows users to add, edit, and delete items from a shopping cart, much like one might see on a shopping website where a user has not yet logged in.
In a real application, this would be coupled with a database that allows users to log in and save the shopping cart between sessions.
